    "text": "<p>In this task, you will be asked to assess the truthfulness of three statements. First, you will be asked to fill in one questionnaire and to answer one question. Then, we will show you&#10;  <strong>3 statements</strong> made by popular people (for example, political figures) together with the information of who made the statement&#10; and on which date. For each statement, we ask you to tell <strong>how much&#10; do you agree with considering the statement true in general (as opposed to false)</strong>; that is, its overall truthfulness. All your answers are given on a 5 level scale, i.e., they must  be selected among 6 different labels. If you wish to change a previously given judgment, you can use the Back and Next buttons to navigate the task and revisit your answers.&#10;  Please note that the statements are not presented in any particular order. You might see many good statements, many bad ones, or any combination.&#10;  Try not to anticipate, and simply rate each statement after reading it. Note that you&#8217;ll need to answer <strong>all questions and fill in every field</strong> in order&#10;  to proceed in the task, otherwise you will not be able to proceed to the following steps. Note that there are some quality checks throughout the task,&#10;  and if you do not perform these correctly you will not be able to terminate the task and get paid. The data from this task is being gathered for research&#10;  purposes only. Participation is entirely voluntary, and you are free to leave the task at any point.&#10;</p>&#10;&#10;&#10;"
